TinyDB (Go port)
======================

### Motivation

The purpose of this project is evaluate the developer experience offered by
Rust and Go by implementing the [same database engine](https://github.com/ldaniels528/lollypop) in both languages.

You can find the [Rust version here](https://github.com/ldaniels528/tinyDB).

I'm just getting started but check back from time to time to see the progress.

### Development

TinyDB (Go) is not yet a working product; and unfortunately progress has been slow due to the
majority of the effort going to the Rust port.

If you'd like to run the tests just to see what's going on:

```bash
go test main
```
